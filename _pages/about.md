I love to read blogs, watch YouTube tutorials and listen to podcasts. I am learning so much from the data community, where knowledge is shared to challenge myself. In addition, I'm an researcher, I'm active on LinkedIn where I discuss and learn from others.

## Hobbies
### Photography
I still vividly remember summer nights during my childhood in Vietnam. My close friend and I lay on my house's rooftop looking up to the starry night sky. We talked about our dreams, about the vastness of the misterious universe and tried to listen to the sound of planets moving. The Milky Way has become a part of my childhood memories since then. Growing up, I bought my first DSLR camera to capture clear pictures of the night sky. Being under billions of bright stars in a quiet night, I feel calm and I can hear my inner voice.

I also made short films about cities I visited to keep beautiful memories of cultures and people I met on the way.

### Long Distance Running
I started running long distance in 2016. Since then I have completed several half and full-marathons. Running pushes me to the limits of my physiscal and mental strengths and beyond. My most favorite book is ***What I Talk About When I Talk About Running*** by **Haruki Murakami**. His book brought me to running, and through running, I can see so much of me in his books.

> "As I run I tell myself to think of a river. And clouds. But essentially I'm not thinking of a thing. All I do is keep on running in my own cozy, homemade void, my own nostalgic silence. And this is a pretty wonderful thing. No matter what anybody else says."
